# TO-DO List // Roadmap

### High priority
- Support for *REAL* FAT32 (hard drives) and ISO9660 (optical discs)
- Use *""* in file paths ✅
- Copy, move, delete commands (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`, including `rm -r`)
	- `cp˙`, `mv` and `rm` works, but `rm` cannot do recursive delete ✅
- Networking tweaks

### Low priority, future plans
- Login system (store usernames and passwords on disk)
- Proper installer for the system
- Custom EFI bootloader
