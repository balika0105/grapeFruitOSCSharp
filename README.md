# grapeFruitOSCSharp
A version of grapeFruitOS written in C#, made bootable with [Cosmos](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos)

### WARNING!

Some features are currently in an experimental phase. Use with caution!

It is highly recommended to use this *operating system* in a Virtual Machine, instead of running it on real hardware.

***We are not responsible for any type of data loss!***

### Additional information
The project has been "rebuilt" due to the changes in the Cosmos Framework.
You can find the older code in the `old` directory.

Please note that after porting over older functionality, this folder will be removed.
